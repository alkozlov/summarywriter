# Kubernetes Overview

Kubernetes is a powerful platform for managing containerized applications at scale. This summary covers key components, advantages, and methods for interacting with Kubernetes.

## Key Components

### Kubelet
- The kubelet is an agent that ensures containers are running in a Pod.
- It acts as a bridge between Kubernetes and the container runtime engine.

### Kube Proxy
- A network proxy on each node that maintains network rules.
- Responsible for implementing the Service concept.

### Container Runtime
- Software that manages containers.
- Kubernetes can work with various container runtimes, though control plane nodes usually don't handle workloads.

## Advantages of Kubernetes

1. **Portability**
   - Containers can run in various environments without modification.
   - Facilitates application deployment in both on-premise and cloud settings.

2. **Resilience**
   - Kubernetes uses controllers to monitor and adjust the state of the cluster.

3. **Scalability**
   - Automatically scales Pods based on demand or resource usage.

4. **API-based**
   - Exposes functionality through APIs, allowing easy client implementation.

5. **Extensibility**
   - Custom extensions can be added to meet specific needs.

## Summary of Kubernetes Structure

- A Kubernetes cluster consists of at least one control plane node and one or more worker nodes.
- The control plane schedules workloads and manages the cluster, while worker nodes execute the tasks.

## Interacting with Kubernetes

### Using kubectl

**kubectl** is the command-line tool for managing Kubernetes. It follows this syntax:

```
$ kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
```

#### Examples of kubectl commands

1. **Basic Command**
   ```bash
   $ kubectl get pods
   ```
   - Retrieves a list of Pods.

2. **Create a Pod**
   ```bash
   $ kubectl run frontend --image=nginx:1.24.0 --port=80
   ```
   - Creates a Pod named `frontend` using the specified image and port.

3. **Edit a Pod**
   ```bash
   $ kubectl edit pod frontend
   ```
   - Opens an editor to modify the live configuration of the Pod.

4. **Patch a Pod**
   ```bash
   $ kubectl patch pod frontend -p '{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"frontend","image":"nginx:1.25.1"}]}}'
   ```
   - Updates the container image of the Pod.

5. **Delete a Pod**
   ```bash
   $ kubectl delete pod frontend
   ```
   - Deletes the specified Pod.

### Managing Objects

#### Imperative Management
- Create, update, and delete objects using commands without a manifest.
- Example command to create a Pod:
  ```bash
  $ kubectl run frontend --image=nginx:1.24.0 --port=80
  ```

#### Declarative Management
- Use YAML or JSON manifests to define the desired state of objects.
- Example command to create from a manifest:
  ```bash
  $ kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
  ```

### Hybrid Approach
- Start with an imperative command to generate a manifest, then modify it for declarative management.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes is a robust platform for managing microservices, providing scalability, resilience, and portability. Mastering **kubectl** is essential for effective interaction with Kubernetes clusters, especially for exam preparation.
